GDI Core Web Accessibility
======================
This is the official Girl Develop It Web Accessibility curriculum, edited for use by Aisha Blake with the Detroit chapter. It was originally developed by Sylvia Richardson. This course is meant to be taught as a single two-hour workshop. There are three components: the course slides (classslides.html), a class activity handout (Kitten Alt text.docx), and an instructor guide (Instructor Guide.docx).

## Suggested course description below

Who can use your websites? Are they accessible to as many people as possible?

Web accessibility is the process of making it easy for everyone to access your web content, regardless of whether or not they approach the web in a typical way. Come to this workshop to learn more about designing with accessibility in mindâ€”and building a better web experience for everyone.

This two-hour workshop will focus on key points to keep in mind when designing for users who include those with vision, hearing, and motor impairments, with some hands-on exercises. It is helpful to have some knowledge of HTML and CSS. We will be using the library's computer lab, so no need to bring a laptop, but please come with a set of headphones.

## Theme customization

You can change theme colors by changing the theme css to any of the following options:
```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/theme/gdidefault.css" id="theme">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/theme/gdilight.css" id="theme">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/theme/gdisunny.css" id="theme">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/theme/gdicool.css" id="theme">
```
You can change the text editor theme by changing the highlight.js css to the following options:
```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="lib/css/dark.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="lib/css/light.css">
```
You can change transition by changing the reveal transition property in Reveal.initialize
```javascript
  Reveal.initialize({
  				transition:  'default', // default/cube/page/concave/zoom/linear/none
  			});
